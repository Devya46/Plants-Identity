        The common name "passionflower" applies to any of nearly 500 species of
        perennial vines in the Passiflora genus, though a relatively small
        number of species are commonly grown as garden plants. These plants gain
        their common name from the unique structure of the flowers and their
        symbolic importance. According to the plant's original catalogers, each
        of the flower's structures can be seen as symbols of the Passion of
        Christ.

        <h3>Temperature</h3>
        <p>
          These plants can be quite warm in summer (household temperatures are
          fine) but like it a bit colder in winter months (down to 50 degrees
          Fahrenheit at night). Passionflower is fairly hardy, and even if they
          die back to the soil (such as may happen if you don't move them
          indoors quickly enough in the fall) they will likely recover next
          spring

        <h3>Light</h3>
        <p>
          Give these plants plenty of bright light, especially during the summer
          growing season. Full sun is preferable in the summer, with as much
          light as you can give during the winter

        <h3>Soil</h3>
        <p>
          When growing indoors, passionflower does well in an ordinary standard
          soilless potting mix based on peat moss.

        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>
          Keep these plants moist at all times during the growing season; you
          might have to water larger plants twice a day in the heat, especially
          if you move them outdoors for the summer. During winter, reduce
          watering but don't let them dry out.
