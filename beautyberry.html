                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>Beautyberry shrubs thrive throughout their hardiness zones and don't have any particular temperature or humidity requirements. A layer of mulch around the base of the shrub can help to keep its roots at a consistent temperature, which will benefit the shrub's overall health.

            <h3>Light</h3>
            <p>Beautyberry shrubs generally do fine either in full sun or partial shade. They naturally grow on the edges of wooded areas where the amount of sunlight they get can vary. More sunlight will result in higher berry production. However, more sunlight will also increase the shrub's need for water.</p>

            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <p>Beautyberry shrubs prefer a moist clay or friable soil (soil with a crumbly texture) that's rich in organic matter. This mimics the forest floor where they naturally grow. However, they can tolerate most soil types except one that's severely lacking in nutrients.

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>These plants like moist soil, but they can tolerate somewhat dry conditions. Roughly an inch per week of water is ideal. But if your shrub is in a particularly sunny spot, you've had hot weather, or you've had minimal rainfall, the plant will likely benefit from more water.</p>
