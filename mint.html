                              <p>Mint is an aromatic herb produced by various species of the mint plant (Mentha). Native to the eastern Mediterranean, mint gets its name from a mythic nymph named Minthe (Mintho). Jealous Persephone turned her into a lowly mint plant after she had an affair with Pluto, the god of the underworld. The mint plant is common and a favorite of many gardeners, so it's easy to grow your own.</p>

                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>Hardiness will depend on the species you are growing, but mints are widely adaptable. Peppermint is very cold hardy, able to withstand the cooler temperatures. Spearmint handles the heat best and can grow in zone 11. </p>

            <h3>Light</h3>
            <p>Mint plants prefer part shade, though you can grow it in full sun if you water it frequently. Mint is one of the few culinary herbs that grows ​well in shady areas.

            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <p>Mint prefers a rich soil with a slightly acidic pH between 6.5 and 7.0. If the soil is somewhat poor, top- dress yearly with organic matter and apply an organic fertilizer mid-season after shearing.

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>One thing mint needs is constantly moist soil with adequate drainage. Mint plants like water, but they cannot withstand soggy soil and wet feet. It is probably best to water the plants in the morning so that they have plenty of moisture by the time the hotter afternoon sun hits.</p>
