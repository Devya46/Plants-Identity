            <p>Aloe vera, sometimes described as a “wonder plant,” is a short-stemmed shrub. Aloe is a genus that contains more than 500 species of flowering succulent plants. Many Aloes occur naturally in North Africa.

                  The leaves of Aloe vera are succulent, erect, and form a dense rosette. Many uses are made of the gel obtained from the plant’s leaves.
                  
                  Aloe vera has been the subject of much scientific study over the last few years, regarding several claimed therapeutic properties. In this article, we will look at some of these claims and investigate the research behind them.</p>

                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>Aloe vera do best in temperatures between 55 and 80°F (13 and 27°C). The temperatures of most homes and apartments are ideal. From May to September, you can bring your plant outdoors without any problems, but do bring it back inside in the evening if nights are cold.</p>

            <h3>Light</h3>
            <p>Light: Aloe vera plants need to be housed in a bright location with some direct sun in winter months. An odd fact about aloe vera is it can sunburn just like us. If you move an aloe vera into direct sunlight from a relatively shady location, the sun can do harm.</p>

            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <p>When growing aloe vera plants, plant them in a cactus potting soil mix or a regular potting soil that has been amended with additional perlite or building sand

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p> Aloe vera plants are drought resistant, so they can survive with minimal watering. However, not watering your aloe vera plant will shorten its lifespan. An appropriate way to water an aloe vera plant is to water thoroughly and let the excess water drain. Then, water again when the top inch of soil is dry. This allows for optimal aloe vera growth. </p>
