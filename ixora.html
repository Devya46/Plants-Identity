            <p>Ixora is an unusual houseplant and one that attracts attention the moment someone sets foot in your house. Native to Asia, ixora plants are actually small shrubs that grow in subtropical regions, making them unsuitable for outdoor growth in much of the country. Started and grown year-round indoors, ixora plants feature large clusters of red, yellow, white, or orange flowers that emerge like puffballs from the evergreen leaves continuously throughout the year.</p>

                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>A warm, moist environment is key for a thriving ixora plant. Temperatures should be kept above 60 degrees Fahrenheit at all times (even in winter); avoid placing your plant anywhere in your home that has a cold draft, like by a nearby window or air conditioner.</p>

            <h3>Light</h3>
            <p>Ixora plants like bright light, so put them somewhere in your home where they can get at least eight to 10 hours of sunlight a day. A word of warning: Keep them away from harsh direct rays in the summer, which can dry out and burn the leaves if you're not careful.</p>

            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <p>For the most healthy ixora plant possible, plant it in a soil mixture that is rich in organic matter and peat-based. Additionally, ixora plants love soil that has a slightly acidic pH level, ranging between 5.5 to 6.5. Soil mixtures that have a pH level above 7.0 can cause the plant to have dull foliage color.

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>True to their tropical nature, ixora plants love being kept consistently moist. Water them oftenâ€”the specific amount will depend on the specific environment in your home. A good rule of thumb is that the soil should never be allowed to dry out, though you can decrease your watering cadence a bit in the winter.</p>
