                              <p>Moonflower is a tender perennial vine that can add incredible beauty and powerful
                                    fragrance to a night garden. Often grown as an annual outside of its tropical and
                                    subtropical growing zones, this vine
                                    features large, heart-shaped, dark green leaves on robust, slightly prickly stems.
                                    Its trumpet-shaped
                                    flowers begin blooming in mid-summer and last until fall. They are typically an
                                    iridescent white and grow
                                    around 6 inches long and 3 to 6 inches wide.1 The blooms unfurl from cone-shaped
                                    buds as the sun goes down,
                                    as well as on cloudy days. They stay open all night, exuding their sweet fragrance
                                    into the air, before
                                    closing up again the next morning. Moonflower is best planted in the spring after
                                    the danger of frost has
                                    passed. It is a fast-growing vine and can reach around 10 feet long in just one
                                    season under optimal
                                    conditions.</p>

                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>These vines thrive in the warmth and humidity of their growing zones. If you live in a cooler
                        climate, wait to plant them outside until the temperature is reliably around 60 to 70 degrees
                        Fahrenheit.
                        Make sure their soil stays moist if your area is experiencing extreme heat or dry conditions.
