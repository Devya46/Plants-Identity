            <p>Star jasmine is a popular flowering vine in California and the southern United States, where it's grown both vertically (like up a trellis) and as a spreading ground cover. It's very fragrant and is known to attract bees—the fragrance is similar to that of a jasmine shrub, though this is a different group of plants.Native to Asia, star jasmine is a liana plant—one that strives to climb vertical supports or other plants in order to reach sunlight. It is considered to be a member of the Apocynaceae family, which also includes natal plum, frangipani, and oleander.</p>

                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>On the flip side, star jasmine tolerates temperatures as low as 10° F. Its leaves start to turn bronze colored once the weather drops below 32°, but many consider that to be an attractive feature. If you’re in a climate which is colder than zone 8, be prepared to bring your plant indoors to overwinter.</p>

            <h3>Light</h3>
            <p>This fragrant jasmine loves full sun conditions… but it’s not as fond as the heat that goes with them. If the temperature soars in your area, provide some afternoon shade. They can also grow in partial-shade conditions as long as they have lots of indirect bright lighting.</p>

            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <p>Almost universally, jasmine prefers well-drained soil. However, different cultivars may like it a bit sandier than others. Clay soils are not recommended without serious amendment to lighten the soil content. Also, jasmine is a somewhat heavy feeder, so be prepared to fertilize regularly.

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>Jasmine prefers regular watering, and most cultivars require humidity to properly bloom. If growing indoors, you may wish to ensure your soil is slightly more moist than if it were outdoors, as the evaporation of the water will help aid in blooming – but make sure it’s not soggy!
