                              <h2>Sandy soil</h2>
                              <p>It consists of small particles of weathered rock. Sandy soils are one of the poorest
                                    types of soil for growing plants because it has very low nutrients and poor water
                                    holding capacity, which makes it hard for the plant’s roots to absorb water. This
                                    type of soil is very good for the drainage system. Sandy soil is usually formed by
                                    the breakdown or fragmentation of rocks like granite, limestone and quartz.</p>

                              <h2>Silt soil</h2>
                              <p>Silt soil is made
                                    up of rock and other mineral particles, which are smaller than sandy and larger than
                                    clayey. It is the smooth and fine quality of the soil that holds water better than
                                    sand. Silt is easily transported by moving currents and it is mainly found near the
                                     water bodies. The silt soil is more fertile comparatively. Therefore, it is also used in agricultural practices to
                                    improve soil fertility.</p>

                              <h2>Cleyey soil</h2>
                              <p>Clay is the smallest particle amongst the other two types of soil. The particles in
                                    this soil are tightly packed together with each other with very little or no
                                    airspace. This soil has very good water storage qualities and makes it hard for
                                    moisture and air to penetrate into it. It is very sticky to the touch when wet, but
                                    smooth when dried. Clay is the densest and heaviest type of soil which does not
                                    drain well or provide space for plant roots to flourish.</p>

                              <h2>Chalky soil</h2>
                              <p>Chalk soil can be either light or heavy but always highly alkaline due to the calcium carbonate or lime within its structure.

                                    As these soils are alkaline they will not support the growth of ericaceous plants that require acidic soils to grow.
                                    
                                    If a chalky soil shows signs of visible white lumps then they can’t be acidified and gardeners should be resigned to only choose plants that prefer an alkaline soil.</p>

                              <h2>Loamy soil</h2>
                              <p>Loam soil is a mixture of sand, silt and clay that are combined to avoid the negative effects of each type.

                                    These soils are fertile, easy to work with and provide good drainage. Depending on their predominant composition they can be either sandy or clay loam.
                                    
                                    As the soils are a perfect balance of soil particles, they are considered to be a gardeners best friend, but still benefit from topping up with additional organic matter.</p>

                              <p>Peat soil is high in organic matter and retains a large amount of moisture.

                                    This type of soil is very rarely found in a garden and often imported into a garden to provide an optimum soil base for planting.</p>
