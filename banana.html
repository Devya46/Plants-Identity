            <p>The fruit, while edible, is not very flavorful, and Darjeeling banana is generally grown instead for the unique foliage, which exhibits a striking cinnamon-red color on the leaf undersides, with leaf tops that sport eye-catching red striped patterns.

                  Like Japanese banana, the Darjeeling banana plant is more cold-hardy than the hybrid bananas that produce the fruit sold in store. It is considered hardy to zone 5, where it can survive outdoors even through occasional snowfalls. 
                  
                  In zones where it is hardy, this banana can be planted at any time. This fast-growing plant may put on as much as 9 feet in its first growing season and can reach 12 to 15 feet by the time it flowers and produces fruit after three years.

                  <h3>Temperature</h3>
                  <p>The Darjeeling banana tree is quite hardy and can withstand mildly freezing winters while still coming back strong and healthy the next year. It's considered hardy in USDA zones 5 to 9.

                        These trees appreciate significant amounts of humidity but beware of excess moisture as the temperatures start to drop. Too much moisture in the winter can be detrimental to the health of this banana species.</p>

            <h3>Light</h3>
            <p>While many banana species are tropical lowland plants that require lots of direct sun, the Darjeeling banana is found in the high forests of the Himalayan foothills, and as such it does well with a fair amount of shade, especially in the warmer part of its hardiness range. In colder climates, give it as much sun as possible.</p>

            <h3>Soil</h3>
            <p>To be able to produce its large flowers and fruit, the Darjeeling banana tree loves rich, nutrient-packed soil. Adding compost or manure will help give this plant the nutrients it needs. This addition will also help the soil drain, which is very important. Banana trees require plenty of water, but if the soil doesn’t drain well, root rot becomes a real problem.

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>The Darjeeling banana tree's tropical nature is revealed by its need for moisture—and lots of it. Be sure to keep it well watered, particularly when it is hot and sunny. Indoor banana trees also appreciate a consistent watering schedule.

                  As the growing season ends and temperatures begin to fall, start tapering off watering to allow the tree to go dormant.
