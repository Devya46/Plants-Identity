            <p>Sweet autumn clematis (Clematis terniflora) is a perennial flowering vine that produces sweetly fragrant flowers in the late summer and early fall, well after most other clematis plants are finished blooming.
                  This twining vine has leathery, shiny, dark green leaves. The flowers are small, white, numerous, and fragrant.</p>
